This is a project I've been looking forward to. It's about a young boy who seeks to discover the truth behind his fathers death, but in doing so stumbles into something should have never known about...
This game is made by spot who has wrote the story (Youtube: spottyboi) Want to contact me personally about bugs? Use my discord: spottyboi#0846
A co writer is Trenton, who is my Boyfreind and is helping code (He doesn't want anything linked)
